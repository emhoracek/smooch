Well, it took me...a reeeeeally long time (when the heck did I start this doll anyway? ^^;;), but 
my second kisakae doll, Blue (another furry O_o), is finally completed. This doll partly took so 
long due to my own laziness, but also because I completely redrew her once because I disliked
the pose of the original doll (but her personality came through in the first doll better), plus I redrew
the body once more after that because I didn't like the proportions (I'm a perfectionist, I can't help
it). But, anyway, she's done now, and I like her a lot ^_^. The colors got a wee bit messed up,
and originally I had the snap-to codes in there too, but the file became hellaciously large, so I 
gave up on the snappy codes. There's not really much to tell about Blue herself, because...well, 
she has no real story to her, I just draw her when I'm bored...and I have no clue what Blue-chan's hair
color is, it's just..lots of stuff I guess ^^;;. The reason that last hair change thingy is there is so you can put 
on the buns without the extra hair...yeah, it's a lame way to do it, but oh well.

CLOTHING NOTES
+++++++++++++

+the long denim skirt with the slit up the front is real..and I'd snap it up in a minute if it weren't so
expensive
+the cloud stockings were inspired by some stockings a girl at school was wearing...I don't know
if they were even really clouds, but I figured it worked well.
+the pants and top with the butterflies on em are pajamas...don't know if anyone could tell that ^^;;
+the sweater in set 7 is almost identical to one that Belldandy wears in the AMG! movie...I got the 
design out of a small booklet from the Nov. 00 volume of Animage.
+the little red thing on the end of the scarf is a fish...it doesn't *look* like one, but that's what it is
+I doubt that a pair of blue mary-janes actually exists (the blue shoes), but if they do, I want em ^_^

FKISS
+++++++++++++

This one's pretty heavy on the FKiss stuff, or at least more than my last doll Kazura (I like hair changes ^_^)

+ press her bangs and they'll change
+press her hair and it'll change
+press the happy lips on the blue box to change her lip color
+press the bun buttons (O_o) to, ya know, do stuff.
+she blinks...yay.
+there's some transparencies...yeah, I know, big deal, but I tried transparencies with my last doll,
but my computer would have none of that, so I'm proud ^_^;;.
++++++++++++
OTHER STUFF
++++++++++++

Please do not use the base doll without permission, if you're that desperate, just ask and I might
make you one. Feel free to use *some* of the clothing designs, but it'd be kinda unoriginal to use em
all, eh? so, in other words, don't rip off my set please ^^;;

     laters ev'rybody,
         her mad hatterness
