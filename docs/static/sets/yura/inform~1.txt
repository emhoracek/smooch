About Kimiki/Navi
---
Hi, I'm Kimiki, or Navi. I'm usually known as Kimiki, but I'm strating to get weary of the name. Unfortunately, though, It's extremely hard to change your online handle when you're involved in a website, several online forums and other online activities. So whenever possible now, I'm putting 'Kimiki/Navi'. Maybe one day I can make the transition. Of course, by then I'll probably be getting fed up with 'Navi' too. And no, I don't play the Link video game. I thought 'Navy' was a cute word, but I wanted to change it slightly to have less military connotation since I'm anti-war. So I changed the Y to an I. Unfortunately I guess it's a video game character too... you can't win.

Anyways, About me... ever since I saw a Kiss doll I wanted to make one. I've always been interested in clothing design, drawing, anime, and computer programming so kiss doll making is like my heaven. Since Yura I think I've made.... 8 dolls. Wow, 8... that number seems too big! Yura makes 9! yii! Well, only 6 of these I've put out 'on the market'. If you were interested, these on the 'market'(for lack of a functioning word) are - Oh! Those in availability to the online public (yay) are Kasio, Kasio does China (I realized the 'hidden message' in the title too late unfortunately), Kagome, Inu-Yasha female cast, Navi, and now Yura. All of these have been in my ankle-less, wrist-less super-SD style but Navi, who was made by a scan of a very simple drawing of one of my self-created manga characters (The one I'm trying to name myself after) when I was practising drawing bodies in various positions during a long period of drawer's block. She's in normal simplified Shounen Manga style. And Of course Yura, who I drew in a more complicated, but still cute way. I except to do more dolls in Yura's style in the future. 

All dolls (except Navi) have been entirely drawn using MSPaint. Believe me, it's tiring. But I like the control.

All of the dolls available to the online public are featured at the BigKissPage at OtakuWorld (http://www.otakuworld.com/) And those that feature cast characters from my favorite manga by Rumiko Takahashi, Inu-Yasha, are featured as well on my Inu-Yasha page (http://members.tripod.com/into_the_demons_lair/). That includes this one, Sasagami no Yura

If you would like to tell me what you like about Yura, or give my suggestions for Yura or future dolls, you can contact me at kimikiness@yahoo.com Hmmmm... I wonder if navi@yahoo.com is taken? Most likely...grrr...

About Sakasagami no Yura

(The Fictional Character)
Sakasagami no Yura (Sakasa: Inverted Gami: Hair No:possesive particle Yu:tie(hair) Ra:net), otherwise known as Inverted haired Yura or as Viz (the company who adopted InuYasha to turn into english) calls her, Yura of the hair. Yura is an Oni, a type of Japanese Ogre, even though she doesn't nessesairily look like an ogre. Yura played a very small part near the beggining of the Manga: In fact, I think she was only present for about 5 issues.

Yura is quite the character. She's very cute, even if she's scantily clad, and very evil. She manipulates razor-sharp hairs that are invisible to the regular human or half-breed's eye (however Magical Kagome can see them). Wherever Yura is, she's surrounded by a huge net/web of these threads. She also uses the threads to manipulate corpses like marrionettes, the threads attached to her fingers sort of like a cat's cradle game. She gets these hairs by brushing the hair of her many many skulls with her red comb. The gets these skulls using her 'Crimson Mist' as Viz calls it (I'm not sure of it's name in Japanese) which severs bone and flesh but leaves hair untouched, so she can behead all of her victims easily without hurting their hair. 

The comb, other than having the power to create razor-sharp and invisible hairs, also held her soul. When not in use, Yura would tuck it away safetly in one of her many many skulls (She's once seen sitting on a massive pile of them... and in her 'lair' she also has another billion held up in a net of hairs.) This way she was immortal. Inu-Yasha severed both of her arms and ripped his hand straight through her chest to no avail, but Kagome figured it out and shattered the comb. Yura faded away. The end of Yura!

(The doll)
Since Yura is one of my all-time favorite Inu-Yasha villains, I just had to make a doll of her. Unlike Kagome, Yura is always seen in only her black outfit, so the rest of the clothing I had to come up with from scratch.

Well, not really scratch. I actually got most of these outfits straight from a Japanese fashion magazine. Isn't their fashion so cute? If you wanted to know, the issue was 'Petit seven, Feb1 2000'. 

Yura's drawn style as well is very different. I was inspired actually by Multi or something. I got a little 'Multi' to sit on my desktop and blink, smile, other cute and inane things. She was s cute I had to draw a doll in her style! It was actually easier then the other styles, to draw.

Why all my dolls lack anatomical and political correctness
---

Incase you haven't noticed, my dolls are as sexless as I can make them without making them of questionable gender. They don't even have defined cleavage lines. None of them.

I'm not trying to make any kind of statements to the effect that the female body is evil. It's more like... hmm, this is hard to explain... Well, American culture has warped the role of women's bodies to sex objects. So it's hard for me at least not to think that when someone draws their dolls completely anatomically corect to think it to be demeaning and annoying, even though probably only half of the artists are even thinking of their doll as sexy in the least. That's also why my dolls are one of the few dolls I know that lack cleavage. You see enough cleavage on television and at high school (If you're unlucky enough to still be there), we don't need to go back on the computer and see more of it.

On another related note, I'm sorry to admit that none of my dolls are of any race but caucasian (is that how it's spelled?) I'm not meaning to be racist or anything by this. The reason all my dolls are white is because either a) I'm working off of a pre-created character from Inu-yasha or maybe even (gasp) another manga or anime (I have a slight obsession running with Inu-Yasha, incase you weren't aware) and have fun finding a black person in feudal japan (the time period for Inu-Yasha) OR I try and the doll either looks slightly tanned or like they're covered in 3rd degree burns. Grrr! But! My first 4 dolls where white-albino-white because of MSPaint 256 colour resrictions, and I couldn't get her to look anything but white or orange. But using transparencies I've solved the problem. Eventually I'll get the Black-skin thing down too, and maybe next doll will have black skin! Oooh, how politically correct!

International Kiss Guild
---
You may have noticed the nifty International Kiss Guild logo on my front page. Well, before Myo, I'd always looked at that logo on other dolls wistfully. I thought it was like a club where people would look at various Kiss doll artists and once the artist proved themselves worthy, they'd allow them to be in the International kiss guild or something like that. All secretive and elite.

BUT one day I decided to visit the PlayFKiss Homepage And my dreams of receiving the "Hey, you're cool enough to be in our elite club! Feel proud!" email came tumbling down when I found out that all you have to do to be in the club is take the badge and stick it into your doll. Grah! No judging or anything! Oh well. 

So even though I'm now dissilusioned and I know that the little badge has no value at all, I still throw it on, because it makes me look important and proffesional. And yeah fine, I want people to look at my doll wistfully. Nobody's perfect...

So if you want to look cool like me, just grab the badge at the International Kiss Guild Homepage (http://www.msen.com/~crandall/ikg.html)

Anyways, I hope you enjoy my dolls. And you can be sure there are more on their way!
