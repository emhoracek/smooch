        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>Smooch is a webapp for viewing and (someday) creating KiSS dolls.
           KiSS stands for Kisekae (Japanese for "dress up") Set System.</p>

        <p>KiSS dolls have been around for a long time, but no new viewers have been created in
          15 years and there's no way to play with these dolls online. Many very talented artists
          spent countless hours making these fun digital toys. Some are wonderful examples of pixel
          artistry. Smooch's goal to make KiSS more accessible.</p>

        <p>Check out Smooch's <a href="https://github.com/emhoracek/smooch/wiki">GitHub wiki</a> if
          you want to learn more about KiSS.</p>

        <h3>How it works</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Paste in a link to a doll file from OtakuWorld or upload a file.</li>
          <li>Smooch checks if the doll is already in the cache.</li>
          <li>If the doll is in the cache, Smooch shows you the doll. If it's not, Smooch downloads and converts the doll before displaying it.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Smooch can only display "vanilla" KiSS dolls for now. It can't display FKiSS effects, enhanced palettes, or Cherry KiSS.</p>

        <p>Smooch is still in alpha testing. Please send bug reports to
          <a href="mailto:libby@daydrea.me">libby@daydrea.me</a> or
          <a href="https://github.com/emhoracek/smooch/issues">submit an
            issue</a> on Github.</p>
