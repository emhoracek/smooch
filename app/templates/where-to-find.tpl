        <h2>Where to find dolls</h2>

        <p>Smooch is a viewer, not an archive. So if you want to view dolls,
          you need to find them elsewhere.
        </p>

        <h3>Archives</h3>
        <p><a href="http://otakuworld.com/kiss/">OtakuWorld's Big KiSS Page</a>
          is the largest KiSS archive with thousands of dolls. Since it's the easiest place to find
          most dolls, Smooch has an easy way to view files from OtakuWorld. Just right click on the
          "Download" image on the doll page and copy the link. Paste it into the input box on
          Smooch's <a href="/">homepage</a> and hit "View". Smooch will download the file for you
          and display the doll.
        </p>

        <p><a href="http://kisscafe.ephralon.de/">KiSS Cafe</a> is another
          great archive of dolls. (If you get redirect to a Sims page, turn off HTTPS everywhere.)</p>

        <h3>Artist Pages </h3>

        <p>OtakuWorld and KiSS Cafe both link to artist pages, and many artists
          had additional dolls that they didn't submit to archives for various
          reasons. Unfortunately, most artist pages are dead.
        </p>
        <p>You can try using Internet Archive's <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a>
          to access dead pages.
        </p>

        <h3>DeviantArt</h3>
        <p>When OtakuWorld became less active, artist Fox Lee created
          <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/kissclub">KiSS Club on DeviantArt</a>. It's now
          inactive but still has a small collection of dolls.</p>

        <p>You may also find KiSS dolls using DA's search engine (although you have to
          dig through all the bases to find them).
        </p>

        <h3>Ask for help</h3>
        <p>If you can't find a specific doll, you can also try asking on the
          new <a href="https://disboard.org/server/950519299364237312">KiSS Doll House</a> Discord.</p>
