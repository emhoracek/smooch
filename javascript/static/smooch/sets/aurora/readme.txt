***Hi! Thanks for downloading my first finished kiss doll, Aurora!***

About her -

I've had about 10 started dolls, but this is the first one I have finished.
I don't exactly know why i chose to finish Aurora but..something about her 
made me love her the most, I hope you do to!

Her name comes from an Alkaline Trio song.

About her clothes -

Almost all of them are my ideas, what I wish I had the guts to wear, etc. 

Some info or credits - 
The orange dress with the green circles came from a Japanese fashion
magazine called Fruits. (My best friend!) The Polka dot skirt came from
there also.
The outfit on the doll in set 4 comes from an anime.
And the "Lovers Rock" t shirt is a tribute to my love for the Japanese 
fashion company Super Lovers. 
The patchies jeans have always been on Kimiki's & Ryogas Girl's sets..So
credit to them. 


Dedications - 
I'd like to dedicate this Kiss to Kimiki, Ryogas Girl and Dov Sherman for
helping me (directly or not). Kimiki and Ryogas Girl's dolls are wonderful
and I admire the time and effort they put in (Sheesh! this doll has taken me
a looong time!)
Also thankx to my best friend Heather, she wouldn't let me give up. :)
