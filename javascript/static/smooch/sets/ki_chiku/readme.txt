Doll by Kimiki

~Artist's Notes~
I made Chikuko in 3 days. This is probably the quickest doll I've made since Kyuko, who also took 3 days I think. 
Anyways, as you might be able to tell, lately I've been really wanting to do very different dolls. For Chikuko I wanted to do something that was at once the same as what I always do, but completely different. So I got the idea to do a doll in a nightmarish, sketchy, crazy artstyle, and give her a stereotype Kimiki wardrobe. I was rather suprised by how easily cutesie fashion lended itself to such a schitzophrenic artstyle. It actually looks almost *right* together! o_o;
I know that her wardrobe is small and there is nothing new in it. That was on purpose. This isn't really a doll that is meant to be played with for hours on end, so much as just something that I thought might be an interesting idea and wanted to see how it would turn out.
