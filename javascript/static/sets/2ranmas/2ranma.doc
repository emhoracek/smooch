Ranma 1/2 - Male and Female Ranma in ONE doll!

WARNING!  This doll contains minor frontal nudity of exposed female breasts in
a purely harmless and non-sexual theme.  If you are too young to see female
breasts or if female breasts offend you, please delete this doll from your
drive.

This is an FKISS set.  I don't know if it will run properly on FKISS on
different platforms since the format seems to vary a bit from one platform to
another.  If you try to run this on a version that doesn't support FKISS or an
early FKISS which doesn't support enough alarms, it will look really, really
bad.  I have tried to optimize the timers in the FKISS code as best I can.
There may be points when the animation looks too slow but I have written such
that it will never go faster than intended.

Since WKISS 0.65e does not support .AU format while not all platforms support
.WAV format, I have included two .CNF files:

FKISSAU.CNF  - Standard configuration using .AU sound file format
FKISSWAV.CNF - Alternate configuration using .WAV sound file format

There is also one additional .CNF file for users without FKISS support:

KISS.CNF     - Plain KISS set for viewers with no FKISS support (boring!)

Other than that, upload it anywhere you like.

Personal notes:
When I first saw the FKISS format, I knew there had to be something really
nifty I could do with it.  I thought about revamping my previous KISS set,
KS_RANKO.LZH but the thought of going back and redrawing all those items
was very daunting.

I'd been wanting to do a single KISS set with both versions of Ranma for a
while.  Originally, I'd been thinking it would be something using some kind
of CEL-masking so that the same item could fit onto either of two dolls.
Then FKISS came out and it became possible to do this using a single doll
by simply animating the doll and all the clothing so that they change shape
from male to female.  I hope you find it fun.

By the way, for those of you who don't know Japanese, the sign the panda is
holding up says, "Musabetsu Kakutou": Anything-Goes Martial Arts.
