Hello ! Thanks for downloading this doll.
Quistis is my first doll. As I don't have a scan, it took me months 
to draw the entire set. I've tried to draw the clothes of the main 
characters of Final Fantasy VIII (with a girlish version of the boys'
clothes) and Final Fantasy VII. 
My next projects are :
     - an expansion of this doll with Rinoa and Selphie, the Galbadian
costume, and Barret and Cid (from FF VII) clothes.
     - a doll of Madoka Ayukawa from Kimagure Orange Road with most 
of the clothes from the manga.
     - traditional clothes from most of the countries of the world.
     - clothes for every type of sports.
That's all for the moment.
Thank you for taking time to read this file. I hope you enjoyed this
doll.
If you have any comment, or would like to help me for making new dolls,
just e-mail me at  superstorm@worldonline.fr
Goodbye !
